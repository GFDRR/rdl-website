**Job Title:** Risk Data Library Standard Technical Lead

**Unit:** GFDRR

**Location:** Washington DC or remote location

**Days:** 75

**Starting Date:** September, 2022

# **Background**

**Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)**

The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) is a multi-donor partnership that supports low and middle-income countries to understand, manage, and reduce their risks from natural hazards and climate change. Established in 2006, GFDRR is uniquely positioned to scale the resilience agenda in these countries by providing funding and expertise for policy advice on improving disaster risk management (DRM) at national and local levels, as it relates to land use, building codes, public health, transport, and education, agriculture, environmental protection, energy, water resources management, poverty reduction, fiscal risk management, and climate change adaptation, among others. This advice, in the context of the World Bank’s policy-based lending, creates both technical capacity and financial incentives that enables formalization of policy changes for improved DRM. The Project Management Unit, located within the World Bank, manages grant resources to carry out GFDRR’s mission.

**Digital Earth**

As part of the GFDRR’s thematic areas, the Digital Earth team aims to enhance the resilience of vulnerable countries and communities to climate change and natural hazard disasters through greater access to and adoption of frontier earth observation tools & services. This is achieved by developing and transferring global knowledge, mobilizing key partnerships, and providing operational support to client-executed and Bank activities in the production and use of earth observation for resilience. The initial key partner of Digital Earth is the European Space Agency (ESA) through a cooperation framework linked to the ESA Global Development Assistance (GDA) program.

**Risk Data Library Standard**

The Risk Data Library Standard (RDLS) is an open data standard to make it easier to work with disaster and climate geospatial risk data. It provides a common description of the data used and produced in risk assessments, including hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and modelled loss, or impact, data. The RDLS provides a unique way to create, store, exchange and use disaster different risk information together. It is at the core of the Risk Data Library, a suite of open source tools to work with disaster and climate risk data. The RDLS has been adopted by World Bank for disaster and climate risk assessments but is intended to be used by anyone involved in generating or using disaster risk information. It is a collaborative project managed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) of the World Bank Group.

For more information about the RDLS see the preliminary [documentation ](https://docs.riskdatalibrary.org/)and the [github page](https://github.com/GFDRR/rdl-standard).
