  title-description: "<p>The library database has been designed to overcome a recurrent
    issue with risk data: different datatypes then to be stored separately. Risk experts
    must access multiple sources to gather the datasets they need, even when those
    datasets have the same origin.</p>"

  content: "<h4>Storing all data types in a single environment</h4><p>Database holds
    hazard, exposure, vulnerability and modelled loss data in the same environment.
    Risk data generated by projects no longer need to be separated. Less effort for
    project teams and less overhead for organisations storing data.</p><h4>Single
    search</h4><p>Being stored in the same environment means all dataset in the library
    database can be accessed with a single search, regardless of data type. Locating
    hazard, exposure, vulnerability or modelled loss data—particularly when produced
    by the same project—will not require risk experts to perform multiple searches
    across different resources.</p><h4>Static links for easier sharing</h4><p>Each
    dataset stored in the library database is assigned its own unique URL. Sharing
    a specific dataset is simple as sharing the link. Recipients taken directly to
    dataset’s individual page with all metadata clearly displayed. Datasets to be
    reliably bookmarked for later reference or access. Users in areas of low internet
    connectivity can take advantage of this to ‘shortlist’ datasets for later download.</p><h4>API
    access and a network of databases</h4><p>Robust API access is built into the Library
    database. Data stored in the library database can be referenced and accessed by
    other authorised resources. And when combined with the single-search functionality,
    this feature lays the foundation for a network of connected library databases—all
    accessible via one search interface— which would significantly reduce the time
    and complexity of locating risk data.</p>"
