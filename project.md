  title: The Project
  title-description: "<p>The RDL project grew out of in-depth community consultation
    on improving access to risk information. Its overarching purpose is to support
    disaster resilience work by making risk data easier and more effective to work
    with.</p>"

  headline: The Objective
  headline-description: 'Improving disaster resilience through better risk information '
  content: "<p>The overarching goal of the RDL project is to improve the quality and
    effectiveness of the worldâ€™s risk information by making the underlying data easier
    to work with. The immediate focus is the data needs of risk assessment, with the
    knowledge that the solutions we develop here will be valuable to many members
    of the DRM community.</p>"

  headline: Project background
  headline-description: 'Reports documenting development under the DfID Challenge
    Fund '
  content: <p class="content paragraph-padding-bottom">The Risk Data Library concept
    emerged from in-depth research into the risk information needs and priorities
    of the DRM sector. In 2014, GFDRR and DfID launched an 18-month consultation with
    donors, data producers and users from over a hundred organisations across the
    DRM community. Several priority needs were identified and seed funding made available
    to projects that would start to address them.</p><p class="paragraph-padding-bottom">The
    Risk Data Library began as one of these projects and addresses four of the eight
    priorities identified in the research:</p><ul><li><p>Plausible hazard scenarios
    for developing countries</p></li><li><p>Open and freely available vulnerability
    functions</p></li><li><p>Exposure datasets suitable for detailed risk assessment.</p></li><li><p>An
    established standard for model interoperability</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.gfdrr.org/en/solving-puzzle-innovating-reduce-risk"

  headline-description: 'Several organisations and teams have given their time, expertise
    or funding to the RDL project to date '
  content: <h4>UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office</h4><p>UK Foreign,
    Commonwealth and Development Office funded the initial research into the information
    needs and priorities of the DRM community which created the foundation for the
    RDL project. FCDO also worked with GFDRR to establish the challenge fund which
    provided the original funding for the project.</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-development-office"

    community research for DfID and managed the challenge fund on their behalf. The
    Labs team has also overseen the research and development of the RDL project to
    date.</p><p><a href="https://www.gfdrr.org/en/gfdrr-labs" target="_blank">GFDRR

    the development of the exposure component of the RDL schema. GEM has continued
    to contribute to the project by developing the modeled loss component and creating
    the unified schema and database.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalquakemodel.org"
