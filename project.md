    risk information for developing countries. The focus is on high-impact activities
    that will promote the creation and use of risk-related data, catastrophe risk
    models, and platforms, and that will improve and facilitate the understanding
    and communication of risk assessment results.</p><p><a href="http://riskdatalibrary.org/assets/docs/communityReports/solving-the-puzzle-report.pdf"

  headline: Frequently Asked Questions
  headline-description: ''
  content: '<h4>What is the Risk Data Library?</h4><p>The Risk Data Library is a system
    for better managing risk data. Its components make working with risk data easier
    and create an effective library system designed explicitly for storing, finding,
    editing and exchanging data for disaster risk assessments. The two components
    are now available: The RDL schema is a new language for describing hazard, exposure,
    vulnerability and loss data. It gives risk experts a single language to describe
    datasets used in climate and disaster risk assessment. The datasets have an underlying
    consistency that makes them highly interoperable, and key metadata fields tailored
    to risk analysis. The RDL database enables hazard, exposure, vulnerability and
    loss datasets to be stored in the same environment, consistent with the schema.
    It provides the architecture for searching and downloading the increasing number
    of datasets using the schema.</p><h4>Who is leading the Risk Data Library project?</h4><p>The
    Risk Data Library project is led by GFDRR Labs. The <a href="https://www.gfdrr.org/en"
    target="_blank">Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)</a>
    is a global partnership that helps developing countries better understand and
    reduce their vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. <a href="https://www.gfdrr.org/en/gfdrr-labs"
    target="_blank">GFDRR Labs</a> uses cutting-edge science and technology to make
    high-quality risk information available faster and at lower costs, and develop
    new tools that allow decision-makers and communities to collect, share, and understand
    risk information. We tailor our approach to support the full range of disaster
    risk management interventions â€” from preparedness to risk reduction to consideration
    of financial solutions.</p><h4>Can I upload data on the Risk Data Library?</h4><p>Uploading
    data on riskdatalibrary.org is limited to GFDRR administrators. The Risk Data
    Library is not intended for public upload of data.</p>'
