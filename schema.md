  headline: RDL Schema
  content: "<p>The library schema is designed specifically for describing risk data
    in a consistent and accessible manner. It creates a structure for hazard, exposure,
    vulnerability and modelled loss datasets that make them easier to locate, understand
    and work with.</p><h3>Benefits</h3><p>Designed to address the challenges of managing
    risk data</p><h4>Common structure</h4><p>The schema establishes a shared syntax
    across hazard, exposure, vulnerability and modelled loss data. This common foundation
    makes all schema-formatted datasets highly interoperable within and between data
    types.</p><h4>Comprehensive detail</h4><p>The lexicon of the RDL schema describes
    risk data at multiple levels of scale. For example, aggregarted national level
    or asset level. Giving risk experts a single language they can rely on, regardless
    of the level of data they are working with.</p><h4>Machine and human-readable</h4><p>The
    schema is designed to be easily comprehensible on its own, without the need for
    additional guides or references, which enables risk experts to quickly grasp and
    edit the contents of datasets they are working with. This also makes schema-formatted
    datasets readily machine-readable, supporting a wide range of applications.</p><h4>Self-contained
    custom metadata</h4><p>In addition to describing risk data, the schema also contains
    important metadata describing the nature and contents of risk datasets themselves.
    These metadata attributes have been specifically selected to help risk experts
    quickly locate and identify the datasets they need for a particular assessment.
    And because this metadata is included in the schema itself, it cannot become separated
    from the data it describes.</p><h4>Linked datasets</h4><p>Datasets can be connected
    to one another via the modeled loss dataset. This means you can retrieve a modeled
    loss dataset and immediately be provided with the exposure data, hazard data and
    vulnerability data used to generate those losses.</p><h4>Comprehensive hazard
    datasets</h4><p>The schema defines hazard data by not only the general hazard
    type, but allows definition of process type, of which there can be more than one
    for some hazards. For example the hazard type ‘earthquake’ includes ground shaking,
    ground deformation and liquefaction process types. Each process type has one or
    more associated intensity units, enabling flexibility to store data in original
    units.</p>"
