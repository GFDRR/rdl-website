  title: RDL Schema
  title-description: "<p>The library schema is designed specifically for describing
    risk data in a consistent and accessible manner. It creates a structure for hazard,
    exposure, vulnerability and modelled loss datasets that make them easier to locate,
    understand and work with.</p>"

  content: "<h4><strong>Common structure</strong></h4><p>The schema establishes a
    shared syntax across hazard, exposure, vulnerability and modelled loss data. This
    common foundation makes all schema-formatted datasets highly interoperable within
    and between data types.</p><h4>Comprehensive detail</h4><p>The lexicon of the
    RDL schema describes risk data at multiple levels of scale. For example, aggregarted
    national level or asset level. Giving risk experts a single language they can
    rely on, regardless of the level of data they are working with.</p><h4>Machine
    and human-readable</h4><p>The schema is designed to be easily comprehensible on
    its own, without the need for additional guides or references, which enables risk
    experts to quickly grasp and edit the contents of datasets they are working with.
    This also makes schema-formatted datasets readily machine-readable, supporting
    a wide range of applications.</p><h4>Self-contained custom metadata</h4><p>In
    addition to describing risk data, the schema also contains important metadata
    describing the nature and contents of risk datasets themselves. These metadata
    attributes have been specifically selected to help risk experts quickly locate
    and identify the datasets they need for a particular assessment. And because this
    metadata is included in the schema itself, it cannot become separated from the
    data it describes.</p><h4>Linked datasets</h4><p>Datasets can be connected to
    one another via the modeled loss dataset. This means you can retrieve a modeled
    loss dataset and immediately be provided with the exposure data, hazard data and
    vulnerability data used to generate those losses.</p><h4>Comprehensive hazard
    datasets</h4><p>The schema defines hazard data by not only the general hazard
    type, but allows definition of process type, of which there can be more than one
    for some hazards. For example the hazard type ‘earthquake’ includes ground shaking,
    ground deformation and liquefaction process types. Each process type has one or
    more associated intensity units, enabling flexibility to store data in original
    units.</p>"
