    class="title-color">What is the Risk Data Library?</p><p>The Risk Data Library
    is a system for better managing risk data. Its components make working with risk
    data easier and create an effective library system designed explicitly for storing,
    finding, editing and exchanging data for disaster risk assessments. The two components
    are now available: The RDL schema is a new language for describing hazard, exposure,
    vulnerability and loss data. It gives risk experts a single language to describe
    datasets used in climate and disaster risk assessment. The datasets have an underlying
    consistency that makes them highly interoperable, and key metadata fields tailored
    to risk analysis. The RDL database enables hazard, exposure, vulnerability and
    loss datasets to be stored in the same environment, consistent with the schema.
    It provides the architecture for searching and downloading the increasing number
    of datasets using the schema.</p><p class="title-color">Who is leading the Risk
    Data Library project?</p><p>The Risk Data Library project is led by GFDRR Labs.
    The <a href="https://www.gfdrr.org/en">Global Facility for Disaster Reduction
    and Recovery (GFDRR)</a> is a global partnership that helps developing countries
    better understand and reduce their vulnerability to natural hazards and climate
    change. <a href="https://www.gfdrr.org/en/gfdrr-labs">GFDRR Labs</a> uses cutting-edge
    science and technology to make high-quality risk information available faster
    and at lower costs, and develop new tools that allow decision-makers and communities
    to collect, share, and understand risk information. We tailor our approach to
    support the full range of disaster risk management interventions â€” from preparedness
    to risk reduction to consideration of financial solutions.</p><p class="title-color">Can
    I upload data on the Risk Data Library?</p><p>Uploading data on riskdatalibrary.org
    is limited to GFDRR administrators. The Risk Data Library is not intended for
    public upload of data.</p>'
