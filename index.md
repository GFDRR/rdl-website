  main-headline: Making risk data easier to work with
  main-headline-description: <p>Disaster risk assessments are more important and more
    effective than ever, but common issues with risk data are beginning to limit their
    application. The RDL was launched to address those issues by developing tools
    and resources designed specifically for the needs of disaster risk experts and
    the assessments they perform.</p><p><a href="http://riskdatalibrary.org/project"

  main-headline: A system for better managing risk data
  main-headline-description: "<p>We seek to create a collection of components to make
    working with risk data easier, each one addressing a different underlying problem.
    Working together, these components create an effective library system designed
    explicitly for storing, finding, editing and exchanging data for disaster risk
    assessments. The first of these two components are now available.</p>"

  headline: The RDL schema
  content: <p>The RDL schema gives risk experts a single language to describe hazard,
    exposure, vulnerability and modelled loss datasets. It gives datasets an underlying
    consistency that makes them highly interoperable and easily read by both people
    and machines. The schema also contains labels for key metadata fields, making
    it easier to identify datasets without relying on external files or descriptions.</p><p><a
