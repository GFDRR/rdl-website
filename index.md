  title: Making risk data easier to work with
  title-description: <p>Disaster risk assessments are more important and more effective
    than ever, but common issues with risk data are beginning to limit their application.
    The RDL was launched to address those issues by developing tools and resources
    designed specifically for the needs of disaster risk experts and the assessments
    they perform.</p><p><a href="http://riskdatalibrary.org/project" target="_blank">Learn

  title: A system for better managing risk data
  title-description: "<p>We seek to create a collection of components to make working
    with risk data easier, each one addressing a different underlying problem. Working
    together, these components create an effective library system designed explicitly
    for storing, finding, editing and exchanging data for disaster risk assessments.
    The first of these two components are now available.</p>"

  headline: The RDL schema
  headline-description: A new language for describing hazard, exposure, vulnerability
    and loss data
  content: <p>The RDL schema gives risk experts a single language to describe hazard,
    exposure, vulnerability and modelled loss datasets. It gives datasets an underlying
    consistency that makes them highly interoperable and easily read by both people
    and machines. The schema also contains labels for key metadata fields, making
    it easier to identify datasets without relying on external files or descriptions.</p><p><a

  headline: The database
  headline-description: Storing hazard, exposure, vulnerability and loss datasets
    in the same environment
  content: <p>The architecture of the RDL database is capable of storing all four
    common types of risk data in the same environment, where they can be indexed and
    retrieved by a single search function. This reduces the number of separate resources
    needed to store risk data, reducing costs and search times.</p><p><a href="http://riskdatalibrary.org/database"

  title: " Developed by risk data experts "
  title-description: <p>The RDL project is the result of the collective effort and
    ongoing support of internationally-recognised research insitutions and established
    global partnerships with combined expertise across multiple hazards and all aspects
    of risk assessment. The partners have a complete understanding of the challenges
    risk analysts face in finding, editing and exchanging data for disaster risk assessments,
    for various scales and contexts.</p><p><a href="http://riskdatalibrary.org/project"
